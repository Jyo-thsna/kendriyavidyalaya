      The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan ('Chain of Central Schools') is a system of premier central government schools in India that are instituted under the aegis of the Ministry of Education (MHRD), Government of India.
      As of October 2020, it has a total of 1243 schools in India, and three abroad. It is one of the world's largest chains of schools.
      The motto of Kendriya Vidyalayas is Tattvaṁ pūṣaṇa apāvr̥ṇu, lit. 'O Sun , please uncover that'; in other words, "where the face of truth is covered by the golden lid, O Sun (God), please uncover so that truth and dharma are visible."
      Kendriya Vidyalaya Kanhangad was established on 14/08/2010. Now, the vidyalaya has classes upto XII with a strength of 533 students.
